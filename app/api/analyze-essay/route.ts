"Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did not know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break.
Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, "I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scaredÂ¬â to complete the test before the timer goes off becauseÂ¬â I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future.
Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakesÂ¬â in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said "I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even thoughÂ¬â you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving.
Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focusedÂ¬â and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the yearÂ¬â I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projectsÂ¬â teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy becauseÂ¬â most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible.
Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking andÂ¬â responsible for their work during the break.Â¬â "

Example 2:
full_text: 
My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.
The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.
Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered "i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.
Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said "88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time". He also said "only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!
Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.

Some students stay home and take their classes online so they learn better and no socail life helps with you getting your work done but that not always the case of this situition .
Benfit of kids taking they class online or video conferncing dont mean they gone always wanna wake up to do it or they gone wait last min to go the classes on online and now they are late behide wiht their work and lesson and dont know where to start. Some kids probably wouldnt benfit the issues with them having to take school from home. When kids wake up they go for there phone their would miss out a whole 2-3 lesson for forgetting about about they got school work to do and that not good at all .
So some of the kids who not doing the school work at home probably would better doing it at school cause you other people and have a social life with other people and asking for help from people who got different ways of looking at stuff just like how you do . All this goes into how attend classes from home is a little bit of a bad idea cause it can also mess up someone inner thoughts by not having friend or not seeing every friends everday at like how they see each other and you might feel left out . Plus that make your friend like they cant do nun with you if you late behide work and you gotta make it up but they asking you can you go somewhere but you cant case you have stuff to do so thry might look at you like yea they happy for you and all but they probably want you to relax sometimes but you cant the wat you want to.
Also what if you wanted to try out for a sport but you taking classes from home for the school probably not gone be easy like being around people who really go to the school and see what goes on at school but you probably just watch videos or hear about it . So it would be the same as your friend and you pushing them off to do work cause you aint finish all you work so how you gone do sport if you having trouble doing your work .
So overall i feel like student/ kids shouldnt take classes or video conferencing from home cause it going to take away time from them to be them and take away their socail life with theie friend and not help them get a good thing coming from them as in with sport or if they wanted to join a club to that they like with the schoo cause wouldnt know how to get in it if they not phycically in school .
